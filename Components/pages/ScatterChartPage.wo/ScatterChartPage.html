	<h3> Scatter Chart </h3>
		Scatter Chart generated from the Model (er.highcharts.demo.model) Company Fleet Vehicles Fuel Economy.
		<div>
			Scatter charts use values in the <pre>series.data</pre> , so this chart maps the <pre>data</pre> option in the series
			to the <pre>values</pre> key path of the FleetVehicleFuelEconomy objects.
		</div>
		<div>
			Because the data for this chart is created randomly at runtime, this example doesn't quite show the power of the Scatter Chart. You'll have to imagine!
		</div>
		<div>
			Note, also, that you can create a marquee in the chart to zoom in to your selected area. Click on Reset zoom to get the original chart.

		<h3>Alternative bindings</h3>
		Alternatively, you can specify the <pre>seriesNameKeyPath</pre> and <pre>seriesDataKeyPath</pre> bindings.
	</div>
	<div>
		Different approach, same result. See Line Chart Page for details.
