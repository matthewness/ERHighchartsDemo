<div class="note">

	<h3> Base ERHighchart </h3>
	This chart is generated without using the convenience components, just the <pre>ERHighchart</pre> component.
	<div>
		The graph is defined almost entirely within this class. All ERHighchart is setting is the HTML container in which to render the chart,
		and the exporting and credit options if they are not already set.
